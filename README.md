**Title:** DataFestAfrica Hackathon 2024: Improving  Academic Outcome For Secondary Education

An important general concern all over the African continent has been the sub-par quality of elementary and secondary education which has been further highlighted by the recent push to Computer-Based tests for students in ultimate classes (especially SSS3). In fairness, there has been some action taken by CSOs, governments and other bodies to improve the quality of education, and by extension, studentsâ€™ performance. 
 
Recent statistics from JAMB (a Nigerian pre-tertiary examination governing body) shows that 76% (approx. 4 out of 5) of students who participated in the 2024 UTME scored less than 200 (50%). This interesting insight emphasizes the need to find proactive solutions to this problem.
